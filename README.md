# Students-credits-score-prediction project done under course on Data Science Programming 

The data used in this task is Credit.
y = student
x = all other variables
Tasks to do:
﻿﻿﻿Produce some numerical and graphical summaries of data (pairplot, correlation matrix, boxplot).
﻿﻿﻿Perform a Logistic Regression and use the summary function to show the results. Describe which variables are statistically significant. Divide data in proportion 80/20 (Train/Test).
﻿﻿﻿Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. Explain what the confusion matrix is telling you about the types of mistakes made by logistic regression
﻿﻿﻿Repeat the step 2-3 with LDA.
﻿﻿﻿Repeat the step 2-3 with QDA.
﻿﻿﻿Repeat the step 2-3 with KNN (k-1,5,10).
﻿﻿﻿Compare the results of Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA and best KNN. Describe and comment the comparison.
﻿﻿﻿Repeat the step 2-3 with 5-fold and 10-fold cross validation.
﻿﻿﻿Compare the results of Logistic Regression with 80/20, 5-fold, 10-fold. Describe and comment the comparison.
